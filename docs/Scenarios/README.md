## Purpose

Scenarios are the end-to-end flows we design, build, and test against. They are the acceptance ground truth for “does the
product work for real users?”.

When scenarios change, update the relevant roadmap and use cases:
- Use cases + user stories: `docs/use-cases.md`
- Client record umbrella roadmap: `docs/client-record-vision-roadmap.md`
- Encounter module roadmap: `docs/encounter-module-vision-roadmap.md`

## Canon scenarios

- Encounter-first scenarios: `docs/Scenarios/Scenarios-1.md`
